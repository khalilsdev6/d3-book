			var dataset = [ 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50 ];
			
			d3
				.select("body")
				// Find the body in the DOM and hand off a reference to the next
				// step in the chain
				.selectAll("li")
				// Select all paragraph tags in the DOM (hint: there are none yet).
				// Since there aren't any yet, it returns an empty selection.
				.data(dataset)
				// Count and parse all the elements of our data set. Everything in
				// our chain thus far is executed 5 times.
				.enter()
				// Enter is what actually creates the data-bound elements. It looks at the
				// current DOM selection, and then the data being sent to it. If there
				// are more data elements than DOM elements, it creates new placeholder
				// elements (these are generic elements, not specifically the 
				// type that we've specified "p"). Then with these ghost generic elements,
				// it hands off a reference to the next line in the chain.
				.append("p")
				// Ah, so since we've done .data(dataset) with an element of length = 5,
				// this is essentially called 5 times. Each of the ghost elements that 
				// append("p") gets called with is going to be replaced with "p". 
				// Then, we pass a reference to this new element to the next step
				// in the chain.
				.text("New paragraph!");
				// Finally, the simplest part to understand- similar to jQuery, we set the
				// inner text of the p tag to be "New paragraph".
